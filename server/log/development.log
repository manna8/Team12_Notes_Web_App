Mongoid::Errors::UnknownAttribute (
message:
  Attempted to set a value for 'password_confirmation' which is not allowed on the model User.
summary:
  User#password_confirmation= was called but there is no 'password_confirmation' field defined in the model, and Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic is not included. This error is also raised instead of NoMethodError if the unknown attribute is passed to any method that accepts an attributes hash, such as #attributes=.
resolution:
  Define the field 'password_confirmation' in User, or include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic in User if you intend to store values in fields that are not explicitly defined.):
