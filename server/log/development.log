Mongoid::Errors::UnknownAttribute (
message:
  Attempted to set a value for 'password_confirmation' which is not allowed on the model User.
summary:
  User#password_confirmation= was called but there is no 'password_confirmation' field defined in the model, and Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic is not included. This error is also raised instead of NoMethodError if the unknown attribute is passed to any method that accepts an attributes hash, such as #attributes=.
resolution:
  Define the field 'password_confirmation' in User, or include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic in User if you intend to store values in fields that are not explicitly defined.):

summary:

resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

message:

summary:
  When calling NotesCollection.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 64217100ed69895784e6c8fa ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 64217100ed69895784e6c8fa.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):
